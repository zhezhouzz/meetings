## Summary

Today we discussed the idea about how to extend our OOPSLA submission, which infers specification of library functions consistent with the samples, but also sufficient to prove the assertion, to incorrectness logic. That is, infer under-approximate specification of library functions consistent with the samples, but also sufficient to prove some bugs on client sides exists. These bugs may be some misusing of the library functions(e.g. initilization lib function f should be called before lib function g, be the client code calls g first). Similar with the set up of the old one, the client code is white-box, but the library code is black-box, we can only sample the input and output of the libarary functions. This is different from existing dynamic symbolic execution that asking the whole implementations are visible.

+ This new framework can be compared against the test generation tools, like quick check, as it is much more smarter than fuzzling. For the first step, we can try to find an example which 1) is buggy(witness by some concerete bad input) 2) but quick check cannot find it easily 3) and under-approximation of library functions can help to find the bugs. This example should be some misusing of the library functions.

+ There should be a measurement about the inferred under-approximate specification. We said they are "maximal" in our old submission, but here it is hard to say which one is minimal in under-approximation.

+ I provide one optimization idea: we should also infer the over-approximation specification of the library functions, which can help the pruning of the verification of client side. As the example below, if we get an over-appriximate specification {true}f(x) = ret{ret < 0}, then the "then" branch can be pruned as these code are not reachable.

```
if (f(x) == 10) {
  ...
  // some large and complicate code
}
```

+ I read 3 symbolic execution papers and I made [a slide](Incorrect-Logic and-Symbolic-Execution.pdf) about them which is also uploaded.

## Summary

+ I introduced an example and my idea about what we talked last week: 1) a client-library program which misuses the library APIs 2) QuickCheck cannot find bug easily because the bugs are corner cases 3) the under-approximation can help to find the bugs. The details are shown in the [slide](Incorrectness&QuickCheck.pdf). The client code is a dfs algorithm which may cause the memory overflow, and only some speceical graphs can trigger the bugs.
+ At the end of the slide, I introduced a refinement loop to infer under-approximate spec and find bugs. The Algorithm is:
    - Treat the library black-box, random sample the library APIs to learn the initial under-approximate specs of APIs.
    - Using the specification and the white-box client code to find an potential buggy execution path(using symbolic execution like way)
    - Random test this path to find if this path is really buggy: if we can find a concerete bad input, we done; otherwise, we guess the specification is not tight enough and need to be refined. We get some good inputs which following the path but will not cause bugs. Using the traces of these good inputs, add them as new samples of under-approximation learning to refine the specification.
+ Here should be a property that, each good input following some path the specifications believes will cause bugs can refine these specifications.
+ The random sampling goes more and more procise, as we do not do non-prior random sampling(like QuickCheck), but we have a path which consistent with specification of library APIs, moreover, these specs are refined tighter and tighter.
+ Ben suggests(as shown in Slack) to "transfer" the specifications of library to the verification of other client code, which can be our second step.
+ The work of following week:
    - Impelement the algorthim
    - Investigate some "white-/grey-box QuickCheck" papers.
